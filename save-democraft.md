# Support & Insight from Tubbo

Hi!

I'm Funasitien, the founder of DEMOCRAFT — a minigame server that you [referring to Kasai] have already visited — and the same person who replies to all your BlueSky posts.

One of our most important system administrators is going to the hospital for the next 4 to 6 months. Unfortunately, they were also the main financial supporter of DEMOCRAFT, which forces us to shut down the public server at the end of the month.

Whether or not we're selected for the Subs Livestream, I wanted to ask something else. When you talked about play.hosting, a well-known YouTuber named **Tubbo** kindly joined your VC to discuss some interesting — though nerdy — details about hosting.

*Quick reminder*: Tubbo is the founder of **TubNet**, which was meant to be the **first crossplay minigames server** — something DEMOCRAFT is actually achieving today.

DEMOCRAFT can’t be saved as-is; the current infrastructure is too expensive. But with Tubbo's experience, I’m confident we could find much better solutions than the ones we've come up with on our own. If we can get in contact before late June, we’d love to show him what we’ve built! It would be a pleasure to talk about our different approaches to resource packs and share the challenges we’ve each faced on our respective journeys.

I'm sure Tubbo — given time — would enjoy a conversation. Kasai [you?] is also more than welcome if he wants to dig deeper into resource pack compatibility on Bedrock. All I’m asking for is a few DMs — it could lead to something amazing for everyone involved.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this message. Again, sorry for reaching out via modmail, but Kasai’s DMs are closed on BlueSky and I didn’t want to come across as spam.

Sincerely,  
Funasitien
