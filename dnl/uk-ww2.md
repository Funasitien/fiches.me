# ðŸ’¥ The United Kingdom during WW2

**In a nutshell**: After the Battle of France, the UK was the only European country from the Allies still standing against Nazi power. The goal of the German forces was to weaken the country by constantly attacking food convoys from the US, destroying military (especially air force) bases, and bombing civilian areas.

The **Luftwaffe** suffered greater losses than the **RAF**, even though the odds initially seemed against the RAF, as the Germans had more planes and pilots.

The UK had a technological advantage â€” with the invention of **radar**, they were able to detect incoming aircraft before they reached British territory.

World War II caused over 50,000 civilian deaths, around 1,000 military deaths, and over 100,000 additional injuries **in the UK**.
