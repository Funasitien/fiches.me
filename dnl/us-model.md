# ðŸŒ† The American Model Challenged

**In a nutshell**: After Executive Order 9981 issued by President Truman in 1948, segregation was officially abolished in the United States. However, major events followed that highlighted continued resistance: Rosa Parks' bus protest on December 1, 1955; the deployment of federal troops by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 4, 1957, to protect Black students; and the first steps to combat voting corruption, which only began in 1957. The struggle was far from over.
